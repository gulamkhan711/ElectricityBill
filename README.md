# ElectricityBill
This project is a Java-based Bill Management System that utilizes Java Servlets, JSP (JavaServer Pages), and MySQL for managing and displaying bill details for both admin and customer users. The system offers an interactive interface for both user roles, with features to view, generate, and manage bills. It is designed for deployment on GitHub and is intended to provide a practical understanding of how Java-based web applications work with databases and user authentication.

Technologies Used:
 Java: The core programming language for building the application, with servlets for backend logic and JSP for front-end display.
 Servlet: Used for handling HTTP requests and responses. The servlets manage the logic for user authentication, bill creation, and fetching bill details.
 JSP (JavaServer Pages): For building dynamic web pages, allowing for easy integration of server-side logic into the user interface.
 MySQL: The database used for storing and managing bill data. It is responsible for holding user credentials, bill details, and various records required by both admin and customer roles.
 HTML/CSS: For frontend styling and structuring the user interface.
Key Features:
 User Login:
 First-time login: Users are required to create an account and login to the website.
 Authentication system: There are two types of users â€“ Admin and Customer.
 Admin: Can manage bills, add new bills, and view/edit all bill details.
 Customer: Can only view and fetch their own bills generated by the admin by entering the bill number.
 Admin Dashboard:
   Add New Bill: Admin users can input new bill details into the system. This includes information such as bill number, customer name, date, items, amounts, etc.
   View and Manage Bills: Admin can view all bills, update them, or delete them as necessary. The bills are stored and organized in the database.
   List All Bills: Admin has a section to list all the bills stored in the database with relevant details like bill number, customer, and total amount.
 Customer Side:
  View Bills: Customers can log in and view their specific bills.
  Fetch Bill: A customer can search for their bill by entering the bill number. Once the bill number is entered, the system fetches and displays the           
  corresponding bill details, showing the customer their updated bill.
MySQL Integration:
  Database Structure: The system uses MySQL to store user data (admin and customer credentials) and bill details (bill number, customer information, date, and 
  amounts).
 CRUD Operations: The application implements basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing bills.
Frontend UI:

The project includes well-designed, simple HTML pages styled with CSS for ease of use.
JSP pages handle dynamic content based on user interactions.
How to Run:
Clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine.
Set up a MySQL database with the necessary schema and tables (provided in the project).
Configure the database connection details in the project to link the application with the database.
Deploy the project on a Tomcat Server or any Java Servlet container.
Access the website via a browser and log in with admin or customer credentials.
Future Enhancements:
Implement user registration for new customers and admins.
Add more complex bill management features like payment tracking and notifications.
Improve the frontend with JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular for a more dynamic experience.
This project demonstrates the use of Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL to create a practical, real-world web application for bill management, making it a great learning tool for aspiring web developers.
