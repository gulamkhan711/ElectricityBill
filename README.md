**Electricity Bill Management System**

This project is a Java-based Bill Management System designed for both admin and customer users. Using Java Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, it facilitates managing and displaying bill details through an interactive web interface.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **Java**: Core programming language with Servlets for backend logic and JSP for frontend display.
- **Servlets**: Handle HTTP requests, manage user authentication, bill generation, and fetching details.
- **JSP**: Used for dynamic web pages integrating server-side logic.
- **MySQL**: Stores user credentials, bill details, and related records.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the frontend UI.

### **Key Features**:

- **User Login**: Both Admin and Customer can log in with their credentials.
  - **Admin**: Manages bills, adds new ones, and edits or deletes records.
  - **Customer**: Views and fetches their specific bills using the bill number.

  - **Fetch Bill**: Enter bill number to retrieve and view the updated bill details.

- **MySQL Integration**:
  - **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete bill data.
  - **Database Structure**: Stores user and bill information.

### **How to Run**:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Set up a MySQL database with the provided schema.
3. Configure database connection settings.
4. Deploy on a Tomcat Server and access via a browser.

### **Future Enhancements**:
- User registration for new customers and admins.
- Advanced bill management with payment tracking and notifications.
- Improved UI with JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular.

This system provides hands-on experience with Java web applications, showcasing the integration of servlets, JSP, and MySQL for bill management.
